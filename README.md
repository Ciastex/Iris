# DEPRECATED, DON'T USE EVEN IF THEY THREATEN YOU WITH SHOVING A CACTUS UP YOUR ASS

~~## Iris
Uses [SdlSharp](https://github.com/panopticoncentral/sdl-sharp) SFML.NET to cobble together a cross-platform "game framework", I guess. Glorified wrapper over SFML.NET is what it is, to be honest.  

~~Don't treat this as production-ready by any means, of course. 
I know jack shit about SFML and this project is just me trying to learn /something/ about it.~~
