## Iris
Uses ~~[SdlSharp](https://github.com/panopticoncentral/sdl-sharp)~~ SFML.NET to cobble together a cross-platform "game engine", I guess.  

Don't treat this as production-ready by any means, of course.  
I know jack shit about SFML and this project is just me trying to learn /something/ about it.
